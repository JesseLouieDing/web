  1.0: The History
</h2>
<p>
	The Rubik's Cube is named after its inventor, Erno Rubik. Like many great inventions, the Rubik's Cube was invented by accident. Being a professor in architecture, Rubik wanted to create a manipulatable model to help explain three-dimensional geometry. After he had created the cube, which he called the "Magic Cube," he soon discovered that he was unable to actually solve the puzzle.</p><ol><h3 id="success">

    After his accidental creation, Rubik had one problem, he had to solve it first. It took Rubik over a month to finally figure out how to solve the cube, but he still had no idea he  created something that would produce over 350 million copies and would be synonymous with the impossible. Today, hundreds of variations of the cube are now in production, with newer cubes being able to turn much faster as well as methods to solve the cube becoming more sophisticated, the fastest time recorded to ever solve the 3x3 Rubik's Cube stands at 3.47 seconds: held by Yusheng Du of China.
