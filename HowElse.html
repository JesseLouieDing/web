  2.0: So, How in the World do You Solve it?
</h2>
<p>
There are actually many, many ways to solve the cube. Before we get into it, you have to look at the cube in a different way. The way solving the cube works is that you recognize certain cases, and perform a memorized set of moves to move onto the next step. Most people begin with what's called the "Beginner's Method," here's a crash course of the 7 steps:
<ol><p>
			1. White Cross: As the first step of the Beginner's Method, create a "Cross" with the white edges of the Rubik's Cube. Make sure that the edge piece colors line up with the cube's centerpieces. </p>

<p>
2. White Corners: Insert the 4 corners that correspond to the correct "pockets" of the cube.
		</p><p>
			3. Second Layer: Begin to insert the correct edge pieces into the second layer. 
		</p><p>
			4. Yellow Cross: Create a "cross" shape on the last layer of the cube. 
		</p><p>
			5. Yellow Edges: Line the edge pieces up with the correct center pieces
		</p><p>
			6. Yellow Corners: Get the corners of the last layer to their correct places.
		</p><p>
			7. Orient Yellow Corners: Orient the corners of the last layer, and you're done!

  2.1: Other Methods</b>
</h3>
<p>
	The more sophisticated the method, the more memorization is needed. Oftentimes, advanced methods rely on computer generated algorithms to find the most move efficient set of moves to solve a certain case. The most popular speedsolving method to solve the cube is known as CFOP, which requires a minimum of 78 algorithms to master. There are other methods, such as ZZ, and Roux, and are all very popular in the speedsolving community.
