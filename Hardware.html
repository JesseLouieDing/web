	The original Rubik's Cube, believe it or not is most often joked about being the worst Rubik's Cube there is. As demands for faster turning puzzles increased as people got faster at solving them, other toy manufacturers began to take on the task of improving the original cube. Today, you can find cubes that are equipped with magnets to improve turning accuracy, spring compression systems to find the perfect tightness, as well as different lubricants to provide the proper cushion when turning.
