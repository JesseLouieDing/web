</body><p></b><b> 1.0: History
</b>
	<p> The Rubik's Cube is named after its inventor, Erno Rubik. Like many great inventions, the Rubik's Cube was invented by accident. Being a professor in architecture, Rubik wanted to create a mmanipulatable model to help explain three-dimensional geometry. After he had created the cube, which he called the "Magic Cube," he soon discovered that he was unable to actually solve the puzzle.
	</p>
	<b> 1.1: Its Success
	</b>
	<p> After his accidental creation, Rubik had one problem, he had to solve it first. It took Rubik over a month to finally figure out how to solve the cube, but he still had no idea he  created something that would produce over 350 million copies and would be synonymous with the impossible. Today, hundreds of variations of the cube are now in production, with newer cubes being able to turn much faster as well as methods to solve the cube becoming more sophisticated, the fastest time recorded to ever solve the 3x3 Rubik's Cube stands at 3.47 seconds: held by Yusheng Du of China.

	<b> 2.0: So, How in the World do you Solve it?
	</b>
	<p> There are actually many, many ways to solve the cube. Before we get into it, you have to look at the cube in a different way. The way solving the cube works is that you recognize certain cases, and perform a memorized set of moves to move onto the next step. Most people begin with what's called the "Beginner's Method," here's a crash course of the 7 steps:
		<ol><p>
			1. White Cross: As the first step of the Beginner's Method, create a "Cross" with the white edges of the Rubik's Cube. Make sure that the edge piece colors line up with the cube's center pieces. </p>

		</p><p>
			2. White Corners: Insert the 4 corners that correspond to the correct "pockets" of the cube.
		</p><p>
			3. Second Layer: Begin to insert the correct edge pieces into the second layer. 
		</p><p>
			4. Yellow Cross: Create a "cross" shape on the last layer of the cube. 
		</p><p>
			5. Yellow Edges: Line the edge pieces up with the correct center pieces
		</p><p>
			6. Yellow Corners: Get the corners of the last layer to their correct places.
		</p><p>
			7. Orient Yellow Corners: Orient the corners of the last layer, and you're done!

		2.1: Other Methods: </b>
		<p>
		The more sophisticated the method, the more memorization is needed. Oftentimes, advanced methods rely on computer generated algorithms to find the most move efficient set of moves to solve a certain case. The most popular speedsolving method to solve the cube is known as CFOP, which requires a minimum of 78 algorithmss to master. There are other methods, such as ZZ, and Roux, and are all very popular in the speedsolving community.

		3.0: Hardware: </p></b>
	<p> The original Rubik's Cube, believe it or not is most often joked about being the worst Rubik's Cube there is. As demands for faster turning puzzles increased as people got faster at solving them, other toy manufacturers began to take on the task of improving the original cube. Today, you can find cubes that are equipped with magnets to improve turning accuracy, spring compression systems to find the perfect tightness, as well as different lubricants to provide the proper cushion when turning.

		3.1: Ending Off </b>
	<p> With competitions occuring all over the world, as well as different variations of the Rubik's Cube such as the 2x2s or even the 7x7, the success of the Rubik's Cube cannot be understated. Thousands of "cubers" world wide compete for the fastest times to become the greatest. </p>
